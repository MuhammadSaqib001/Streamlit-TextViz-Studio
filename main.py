st.markdown("<p class='markdown-text'>TextViz Studio is an all-in-one platform designed to simplify complex text analysis for social scientists and researchers. Delving into programming and data science can be daunting, especially when our primary focus as social scientists is on the substantive aspects of our work. That's why I've set to streamline a suite of existing tools in a more intuitive way that eliminates the need for coding expertise, allowing users to uncover deep insights from textual data effortlessly. Ultimately, the vision of this project is to democratize data science tools for the social science community, making them more accessible and user-friendly. I aim to remove technical barriers by providing user-friendly interfaces that require no coding knowledge, empowering users to focus on what truly matters‚Äîanalyzing and interpreting the substantive content of their research.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.markdown("### **About the Developer**")
st.markdown("""
TextViz Studio was developed by [Jos√© J. Alcocer](https://alcocer-jj.github.io/), a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Political Science and International Relations at the 
University of Southern California. Specializing in computational social science and political methodology, they focus on leveraging 
machine learning and natural language processing to address complex questions in social science‚Äîparticularly those related to 
race and ethnicity. As a graduate research associate at the Security and Political Economy Lab (SPEC), they contribute to projects 
that utilize advanced NLP models to analyze communication patterns and their impacts on communities. With experience working as 
a survey statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau and as a computational social scientist at The Center for Election Science, they bring 
a wealth of expertise in data analysis and research methods. Their passion for bridging the gap between data science and social science
drives their commitment to facilitating tools that empower researchers to explore and understand their data more effectively.
